# DHCP-Client
DHCP Client for network verification, on the Arduino platform..

Hi, this sketch was tested and configured on the platform "Arduino NANO" and works fine!

All he can do is get an IP address, display it on a small screen and make a PING on the server. It covers my needs.

Please note that this project is my first serious development, parts of the code were taken from examples of the library.

This is my first experience therefore you shouldn't concern prejudicedly.
